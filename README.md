# AutoComposingMailer
This program allows you to send multiple emails with files that are composed to a pre-selected layout.
## Why?
This program was developed for satisfying the need of sending multiple files to multiple clients at the same time with a tree-like folders directory.
## How it works?
You create a folder with the assistant in the first form, then you put the files in the corresponding folder and press Scan, then you accept it and they are sent.
You should recompile the program changing the //Customizable sections (changing COMPANY0 and COMPANY1 by the names of the companies you are writing from and the prebuilt message).
Remember that you should configure your SMTP server and user.
